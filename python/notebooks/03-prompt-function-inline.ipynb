The name was relatively common in the Hellenistic world, in Egypt and elsewhere, and she cannot be further identified.

Following three epigrams by Julia Balbilla, a fourth epigram, in elegiac couplets, entitled and presumably authored by \"Demo\" or \"Damo\" (the Greek inscription is difficult to read), is a dedication to the Muses.[2] The poem is traditionally published with the works of Balbilla, though the internal evidence suggests a different author.[1]\n",

                "Demo, like Julia Balbilla, writes in the artificial and poetic Aeolic dialect. The language indicates she was knowledgeable in Homeric poetry—'bearing a pleasant gift', for example, alludes to the use of that phrase throughout the Iliad and Odyssey.[a][2] \n",
