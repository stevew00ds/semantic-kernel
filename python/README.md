# Get Started with Semantic Kernel âš¡

Install the latest package:

    python -m pip install --upgrade semantic-kernel

If you want to use some of the optional dependencies (OpenAI is installed by default), you can install them with:

    python -m pip install --upgrade semantic-kernel[hugging_face]

or all of them:

    python -m pip install --upgrade semantic-kernel[all]

# AI Services

## OpenAI / Azure OpenAI API keys

Make sure you have an
[OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com) or
[Azure OpenAI service key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?pivots=rest-api)

Copy those keys into a `.env` file (see the `.env.example` file):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_ORG_ID=""
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=""
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

# Running a prompt

```python
import asyncio
from semantic_kernel import Kernel
from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import OpenAIChatCompletion, AzureChatCompletion
from semantic_kernel.prompt_template import PromptTemplateConfig
from semantic_kernel.utils.settings import openai_settings_from_dot_env, azure_openai_settings_from_dot_env

kernel = Kernel()

# Prepare OpenAI service using credentials stored in the `.env` file
api_key, org_id = openai_settings_from_dot_env()
service_id="chat-gpt"
kernel.add_service(
    OpenAIChatCompletion(
        service_id=service_id,
        ai_model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        api_key=api_key,
        org_id=org_id
    )
)

# Alternative using Azure:
# deployment, api_key, endpoint = azure_openai_settings_from_dot_env()
# kernel.add_service(
#   AzureChatCompletion(
#       service_id=service_id,
#       deployment_name=deployment,
#       endpoint=endpoint,
#       api_key=api_key

does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

prompt_template_config = PromptTemplateConfig(
    template=prompt,
    name="tldr",
    template_format="semantic-kernel",
    execution_settings=req_settings,
)

function = kernel.add_function(
    function_name="tldr_function",
    plugin_name="tldr_plugin",
    prompt_template_config=prompt_template_config,

# Run your prompt
# Note: functions are run asynchronously
async def main():
    result = await kernel.invoke(function)
    print(result) # => Robots must not harm humans.

# Summarize the laws of motion
print(await kernel.invoke(summarize, input="""
1. An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
2. The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.
3. Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first."""))

# Summarize the law of universal gravitation
print(await kernel.invoke(summarize, input="""
Every point mass attracts every single other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points.
The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."""))

# Output:
# > Energy conserved, entropy increases, zero entropy at 0K.
# > Objects move in response to forces.
# > Gravitational force between two point masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

# SK Frequently Asked Questions

## How does Python SK compare to the C# version of Semantic Kernel?

The two SDKs are compatible and at the core they follow the same design principles.
Some features are still available only in the C# version, and being ported
Refer to the [FEATURE MATRIX](../FEATURE_MATRIX.md) doc to see where
things stand in matching the features and functionality of the main SK branch.
Over time there will be some features available only in the Python version, and
others only in the C# version, for example adapters to external services,
scientific libraries, etc.
