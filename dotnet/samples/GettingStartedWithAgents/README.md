# Semantic Kernel Agents - Getting Started

This project contains a collection of examples on how to use SK Agents.

The examples can be run as integration tests but their code can also be copied to stand-alone programs.

## Running Examples with Filters

You can run specific examples in the project by using test filters (dotnet test --filter).
Type "dotnet test --help" at the command line for more details.

## Configuring Secrets

Most of the examples will require secrets and credentials, to access OpenAI, Azure OpenAI,
Bing and other resources. We suggest using .NET
[Secret Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets)
to avoid the risk of leaking secrets into the repository, branches and pull requests.
You can also use environment variables if you prefer.

To set your secrets with Secret Manager:

```
cd dotnet/samples/AgentSyntaxExamples

dotnet user-secrets init

dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAI:ChatModelId" "..."
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAI:ApiKey" "..."

dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:DeploymentName" "..."
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:ChatDeploymentName" "..."
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:Endpoint" "https://... .openai.azure.com/"
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI:ApiKey" "..."

```
